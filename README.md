# Space Obstacles

This is the source code of [https://obstacles.space/], a game I build with my sons. It's a simple [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) written from scratch (no game engine used). All graphics, sounds, levels, rules, and the game concept have been provided to me at home and I'm simply the implementor.
