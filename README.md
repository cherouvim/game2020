# Space Obstacles

This is the source code of https://obstacles.space/, a simple game I build with my kids. It's a [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) written from scratch in JavaScript without using a game engine. All graphics, sounds, rules, levels, and the game concept itself have been provided to me as is. I am simply the ~~implementor~~ <ins>code monkey :monkey:</ins> of the project.
