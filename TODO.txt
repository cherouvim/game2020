TODOs
- input rotations, speeds, pallete rotations etc
- adjust graphics sizes on files? or setup size on data?
- calculate game screen (max X, Y -> resize/scale canvas on more than that, or simply center a bounded box).
- implement x, y & rotate movement based on time
- implement sizex, sizey based on canvas size
- optimize graphics (png 256 alpha contains extra photo at the corners???)
- webp
